## Hi there, I'm Syusey🐾

🌍 I am a Japanese website creator. My service provides WordPress customization and support for a limited number of people. Beside that, I'm learning the front end. It's a lot of fun to know that new technologies can efficiently build websites. 

📕 Basic learning experience: HTML, CSS, Sass, JavaScript, Docker, PHP, Ruby, Python, Java, Unity, MySQL, GAS, React, Vue.js, Node.js, Android Apps, Git, GitHub Actions, Headless cms and much more!

🌱 I want to apply these technologies, so I am learning every day. I think inspiration and ideas are important as well as learning.

### Design tools in use

💻 Visual Studio Code  
🖊 Illustrator, Photoshop, Inkscape, CLIP STUDIO, Canva  
💡 Illustrator and Photoshop are learning online.
